## Description

The purpose of of this project was to create an interface that would allow a manager to easily find employees in a database and track them. By that they can add a role to an employee, a salary, and a corresponding department and manager. They can update the role of an employee as well.

## Installation

To install my project, a user will have to make sure they're running inquirer version 8.2.4. You can do this through your terminal by entering npm i inquirer@8.2.4. They will also need to install Postgres.

## Usage

To use my application, you're going to have to open a terminal with all dependencies installed. In that terminal, run node inquirer.js to start with the question prompts. The user will have the opportunity to choose from a list of categories that are generated from the inquirer.js file. They can look at all departments, add a role, add an employee, and much more. The inquirer will prompt the user through all the steps. [employee-tracker.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jVxqx_HG_QFeRnIWnSrP331pxKLJ5HXH/view?usp=sharing)
